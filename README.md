LTU, also known as Long-term unemployment, means being out of the workforce for
over a year while actively seeking out to find employment. This issue has often affected certain
groups over time, moreover minorities. Now, we're using AI more and more to help with hiring
along with figuring out who might stay out of work for a longer period of time. This tech has the
ability to be a suitable way to make things more efficient, but it also brings some interesting
problems. Although AI has the potential to improve long-term unemployment prediction
accurately, its application has raised many ethical issues as well as questions related to privacy,
bias, and data misuse.
